# agents.md

This document defines the rules an agent must follow when working in this monorepo (NestJS, MongoDB, Redis, Hive parsing). All changes must be production-ready.

## 1. General principles

- Prefer simplicity over cleverness.
- Avoid premature abstraction.
- Keep modules loosely coupled.
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Layering

- Repository pattern is mandatory (base: `MongoRepository<TDocument>` in `@waivio-core-services/clients`).
- App-specific repositories:
  - Location: `apps/<app>/src/repositories/`
  - Must extend the base repository where appropriate.
- Domain logic (parsers, handlers):
  - Location: `apps/<app>/src/domain/`
- Configuration:
  - Location: `apps/<app>/src/config/`
- Constants:
  - Location: `apps/<app>/src/constants/`
- Controllers must not contain business logic.
- Repositories must not contain business logic (data access only).

### 2.2 Module boundaries

- Apps (`apps/*`) must not depend on other apps.
- Shared logic must live in `libs/`.
- Libs must not import from apps.
- Avoid circular dependencies.
- Each lib must have a clear responsibility:
  - `@waivio-core-services/clients` - database, cache, and blockchain clients (Mongo, Redis, Hive)
  - `@waivio-core-services/common` - shared utilities
  - `@waivio-core-services/processors` - blockchain processing logic

### 2.3 App structure

Inside `apps/<app>/src/`:

- `config/` - env validation (Zod), config factories
- `constants/` - app-specific constants
- `domain/` - business logic, parsers, handlers, schemas
- `repositories/` - app-specific repository implementations

## 3. Repository vs Service layer

### 3.1 Repository rules (data access only)

Repository code:

- Builds MongoDB queries and aggregation pipelines:
  - `$match`, `$lookup`, `$set`, `$push`, filters, projections, lookups, etc.
- Knows collection names, document structure, indexes.
- Returns typed data and hides Mongoose/MongoDB internals.
- Contains no business decisions and no orchestration.

### 3.2 Service rules (business logic only)

Service/domain code:

- Contains formulas, calculations, decisions, orchestration.
- Calls repository methods and never builds pipelines or raw Mongo filters.
- Coordinates multiple repositories when needed.

### 3.3 Red flags (must fix)

Move to repository:

- Service contains `$match`, `$lookup`, `$set`, `$push`.
- Service references collection names (example: `'waiv-stakes'`).

Move to service/domain:

- Repository contains `if/else` business decisions.
- Repository calls other repositories (orchestration belongs in service/domain).

## 4. Monorepo structure

- Nx monorepo (configured in `nx.json`).
- `apps/` - runnable NestJS applications (example: hive-parser, api-service, objects-bot)
- `libs/` - reusable NestJS libraries (clients, common, processors)

Rules:

- Apps can import from libs only via `@waivio-core-services/*`.
- Libs can import from other libs only via barrel exports (`index.ts`).
- Never import deep internal files from another lib.
- Each project has a `project.json` defining targets (build, serve, test, lint).

Correct:

- `import { MongoRepository, MongoClientFactory } from '@waivio-core-services/clients';`
- `import { JsonHelper } from '@waivio-core-services/common';`
- `import { HiveProcessorModule } from '@waivio-core-services/processors';`

Wrong:

- `import { MongoRepository } from '@waivio-core-services/clients/mongo-client/mongo.repository';`

Indexing rules:

- Every lib must have a barrel `index.ts` at `libs/<lib>/src/index.ts`.
- Every sub-module within a lib should have its own `index.ts`.

## 5. Package management

### 5.1 Root-level dependencies

- Single root `package.json` (Nx monorepo) for development.
- Use `npm install` / `npm update` at workspace root.
- Never manually write versions into `package.json`.
- Shared dependencies managed at root level.
- Keep dependency graph minimal.

**Key runtime dependencies (shared at root):**

- `@nestjs/*`, `mongoose`, `ioredis`, `@hiveio/dhive`, `zod`, `rxjs`, `ws`, `lodash`, `axios`

### 5.2 Project-level dependencies

Each project (app/lib) can generate its own `package.json`:

- **Libraries**:
  - Libraries with workspace dependencies (e.g., `clients` depends on `common`) are bundled by apps during app builds
  - Standalone libraries without dependencies (e.g., `common`) can have build targets with `generatePackageJson: true`
  - Libraries are not built separately - they're included in app builds via webpack bundling
  - Generated `package.json` for apps includes all workspace library dependencies
- **Applications**:
  - Webpack generates `package.json` automatically during build
  - Generated files appear in `dist/apps/<app-name>/`
  - Use `prune-lockfile` target to generate minimal dependencies for deployment
  - App builds automatically include and bundle dependent libraries

**Project dependency graph (declared in `project.json`):**

- `hive-parser` → depends on: `clients`, `common`, `processors`
- `processors` → depends on: `clients`, `common`
- `clients` → depends on: `common`
- `common` → no internal dependencies

**Implicit dependencies:**

- Declared via `implicitDependencies` in each project's `project.json`
- Helps Nx understand the project graph for:
  - Build ordering (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`)
  - Affected calculations
  - Caching strategies
- Nx automatically builds dependencies before dependents

### 5.3 Dependency pruning for deployment

**For applications:**

- **Automatic**: Webpack generates `package.json` automatically during `nx build <app>`
  - Only includes packages that are actually imported/used in the code
  - Unused packages from root `package.json` are automatically excluded
  - Generated file: `dist/apps/<app>/package.json`
- **Lockfile** (optional): Use `nx run <app>:generate-lockfile` for reproducible Docker builds
  - Generates `package-lock.json` from the webpack-generated `package.json`
  - Ensures consistent dependency versions in Docker
  - Generated file: `dist/apps/<app>/package-lock.json`

**For libraries:**

- Build generates `package.json` with only required dependencies
- Use for publishing or bundling libraries separately

**Commands:**

- `nx build <app>` - Builds app and auto-generates `package.json` (includes only used packages)
- `nx run <app>:generate-lockfile` - Generates `package-lock.json` for reproducible Docker builds (optional)
- `nx run <app>:prune` - Runs both `generate-lockfile` and `copy-workspace-modules`

**Docker workflow:**

1. **Build**: `nx build <app>`
   - ✅ Automatically generates `dist/apps/<app>/package.json`
   - ✅ Only includes packages that are actually imported/used
   - ✅ Unused packages are automatically excluded
   - ✅ No manual `package.json` creation needed!

2. **Lockfile** (optional): `nx run <app>:generate-lockfile`
   - Generates `package-lock.json` from the webpack-generated `package.json`
   - Ensures consistent dependency versions in Docker
   - Recommended for production Docker builds

3. **Docker**: Copy `dist/apps/<app>/` directory and run `npm ci --only=production`

**Example:**

```bash
# Build (generates package.json automatically)
nx build hive-parser

# Optional: Generate lockfile for Docker
nx run hive-parser:generate-lockfile

# Docker: dist/apps/hive-parser/ contains everything needed
cd dist/apps/hive-parser
npm ci --only=production
node main.js
```

**Docker build:**

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -f apps/<app>/Dockerfile -t <app>:latest .

# Run container
docker run <app>:latest
```

See `apps/<app>/Dockerfile` for the actual Dockerfile (Node.js 24.12.0-alpine3.23).

### 5.4 Dependency management rules

**Development:**

- Use root `node_modules` for all development work
- Install new dependencies at root: `npm install <package>`
- Nx resolves dependencies from root during development

**Production/Deployment:**

- Use generated `package.json` files from `dist/` directories
- Run `npm install --production` in `dist/apps/<app>/` for deployment
- Each app/lib can be deployed independently with minimal dependencies

**Adding new dependencies:**

1. Install at root: `npm install <package>`
2. If app-specific, document in project README or comments
3. Build will automatically include in generated `package.json` if used
4. For deployment, use `prune-lockfile` to generate minimal set

**Version conflicts:**

- Monitor for version mismatches between root and project-level
- Prefer resolving at root level when possible
- Use project-level only when necessary for deployment isolation

## 6. Type safety and validation

- TypeScript strict null checks enabled (`strictNullChecks: true`).
- `noImplicitAny` is currently false:
  - Prefer explicit types for new code.
  - Avoid widening `any` usage.
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is off:
  - Use `any` only when truly necessary (example: Mongoose internals).
  - Prefer `unknown` for new code.

Use Zod for runtime validation of:

- Environment variables (see `apps/<app>/src/config/env.validation.ts`).
- Blockchain payloads (custom JSON operations).
- HTTP request bodies.

Never trust external input:

- Blockchain data, API requests, env vars.

Validate environment at startup:

- Use `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validate })` pattern.

## 7. Configuration

- No hardcoded secrets.
- All configuration via environment variables.
- Each app must have:
  - `config/env.validation.ts` - Zod schema + validate function
  - `config/<app>.config.ts` - config factory (default export function)
- Use `@nestjs/config` with:
  - `ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true, validate, load })`
- Fail fast on invalid configuration (Zod throws on parse failure).
- `.env` files are gitignored.

## 8. Logging and observability

- Use NestJS `Logger` from `@nestjs/common`.
- Create logger per class: `new Logger(ClassName.name)`.
- No `console.log` in production code.
- Do not log secrets or connection strings.
- Log errors with context (at minimum): `this.logger.error(error.message)`.

## 9. Error handling

- Repository base class catches and logs errors and returns `null` / empty arrays (established pattern).
- Domain/service layer must check for `null` returns from repositories and handle appropriately.
- Use typed error classes for domain errors when needed.
- Map domain errors to HTTP responses in controllers.
- Do not expose stack traces to clients.
- Fail fast for unrecoverable errors (invalid config, missing connections).

## 10. Testing

- Jest with `ts-jest`.
- Unit tests: `*.spec.ts` (co-located with source).
- E2E tests: `*.e2e-spec.ts` (in `apps/<app>/test/`).
- Domain/business logic must be unit-testable without NestJS container.
- Mock infrastructure (repositories, clients).
- Test behavior, not implementation.

Commands:

- `nx test <project>` - run tests for a project
- `nx test <project> --watch` - watch mode
- `nx test <project> --coverage` - with coverage

## 11. Performance

- Blockchain processing is the hot path:
  - Avoid blocking operations in parsers.
- MongoDB pool is pre-configured (example: `maxPoolSize 20`, `minPoolSize 2`).
- Redis URL rotation is handled by `UrlRotationService` in `@waivio-core-services/clients`.
- Be mindful of memory when processing blocks sequentially.
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in block/transaction loops.

## 12. Security

- Validate and sanitize all input (blockchain JSON, API requests).
- Protect against injection in MongoDB queries.
- Avoid mass assignment: use explicit field mapping.
- Prevent prototype pollution when parsing custom JSON from blockchain.
- Connection strings and secrets only via env vars, never committed.

## 13. Documentation

- Prefer latest official docs:
  - NestJS v11: https://docs.nestjs.com
  - Mongoose v9: https://mongoosejs.com/docs
  - Zod: https://zod.dev
  - `@hiveio/dhive`: https://github.com/openhive-network/dhive
- Use context7 MCP when available.
- Do not rely on outdated blog posts.

## 14. Code style

- ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) with typescript-eslint + Prettier.
- Prettier: single quotes, trailing commas (all), auto endOfLine.
- Unused vars must be prefixed with `_`.
- Floating promises: warn.
- Prefer small focused functions.
- Prefer composition over inheritance (except `MongoRepository` base class).
- Use descriptive names.
- Avoid deep nesting (prefer early returns).
- Avoid magic numbers (use constants).
- No dead or commented-out code.
- Comments in English only.

## 15. Build and run

### 15.1 Building projects

**Libraries:**

- `nx build <lib>` - Builds library using `@nx/js:tsc` executor
- Generates `package.json` automatically if `generatePackageJson: true` is set
- Output: `dist/libs/<lib-name>/`
- Dependencies: Automatically builds dependent libs first (`dependsOn: ["^build"]`)
- **Note**: Libraries with workspace dependencies (e.g., `clients` depends on `common`) are typically built as part of app builds. Standalone library builds work best for libraries without workspace dependencies.

**Applications:**

- `nx build <app>` - Builds app using webpack via `@nx/webpack`
- Generates `package.json` automatically via webpack config
- Output: `dist/apps/<app-name>/`
- Dependencies: Automatically builds dependent libs first

**Build order:**

- Nx automatically determines build order based on `implicitDependencies`
- Example: Building `hive-parser` will build `common` → `clients` → `processors` → `hive-parser`

### 15.2 Development

- Dev: `nx serve <project>` (continuous mode with watch)
- Uses root `node_modules` for all dependencies
- Hot reload enabled for apps

### 15.3 Production

**Build and deploy:**

- Build: `nx build <app>` (production build)
  - Automatically generates `dist/apps/<app>/package.json` with only used packages
  - No manual `package.json` creation needed
  - Unused packages are automatically excluded
- Prune dependencies: `nx run <app>:prune-lockfile` (optional, for Docker optimization)
  - Generates minimal `package.json` + `package-lock.json`
  - Recommended for Docker images to minimize size
- Deploy: `cd dist/apps/<app> && npm ci --only=production && node main`
- Docker: See `apps/<app>/Dockerfile.example` for multi-stage build setup

**Key points:**

- ✅ No manual `package.json` creation - webpack generates it automatically
- ✅ Only imported/used packages are included - unused packages excluded automatically
- ✅ Perfect for Docker - minimal dependencies = smaller images
- ✅ Each app has its own `tsconfig.app.json` extending root `tsconfig.base.json`
- ✅ Each lib has its own `tsconfig.lib.json`
- ✅ Project configuration in `project.json` (targets: build, serve, test, lint)
- ✅ Use `nx run <project>:<target>` for explicit target execution

## 16. Git and changes

- Do not introduce breaking changes silently.
- Keep commits focused.
- Update types when modifying contracts.
- Refactor safely.
- Do not commit `.env` files or secrets.

## General Guidelines for working with Nx

- For navigating/exploring the workspace, invoke the `nx-workspace` skill first - it has patterns for querying projects, targets, and dependencies
- When running tasks (for example build, lint, test, e2e, etc.), always prefer running the task through `nx` (i.e. `nx run`, `nx run-many`, `nx affected`) instead of using the underlying tooling directly
- Prefix nx commands with the workspace's package manager (e.g., `pnpm nx build`, `npm exec nx test`) - avoids using globally installed CLI
- You have access to the Nx MCP server and its tools, use them to help the user
- For Nx plugin best practices, check `node_modules/@nx/<plugin>/PLUGIN.md`. Not all plugins have this file - proceed without it if unavailable.
- NEVER guess CLI flags - always check nx_docs or `--help` first when unsure

## Scaffolding & Generators

- For scaffolding tasks (creating apps, libs, project structure, setup), ALWAYS invoke the `nx-generate` skill FIRST before exploring or calling MCP tools

## When to use nx_docs

- USE for: advanced config options, unfamiliar flags, migration guides, plugin configuration, edge cases
- DON'T USE for: basic generator syntax (`nx g @nx/react:app`), standard commands, things you already know
- The `nx-generate` skill handles generator discovery internally - don't call nx_docs just to look up generator syntax
